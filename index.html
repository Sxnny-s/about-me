                <p class="content">From a young age, I’ve always been fascinated by technology. In 7th grade, I taught myself how to fix iPhones and even repaired my classmates’ phones. This early interest in tech led me to dive deep into PC gaming, where I spent thousands of hours immersed in various games and eventually built my own PC. These experiences naturally steered me towards a career in programming. Now, I’m pursuing my passion for software engineering, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the foundation for my future in the tech industry.</p>

                <p class="content"> Running has been a significant part of my life since I started at around 13 years old. Over the years, it has become more than just a hobby; it’s been a constant source of discipline, teaching me the importance of setting and achieving goals. Running has also been an invaluable stress reliever for me—whenever I feel anxious, a good run always helps to clear my mind and bring me back to a place of calm.</p>

            <img src="" alt="">
            <p class="content">I received my first balisong as a gift from my father when I graduated middle school at 13. I spent countless hours learning new tricks and perfecting my combos. Although other interests took over for a time, I rekindled my passion for balisong flipping in early 2024 and have been more into it than ever before. I’ve built a collection that I’m quite proud of and even taught myself how to tune balisongs with a micrometer. Eventually, I’d like to explore modding balisongs as a side job.</p>
